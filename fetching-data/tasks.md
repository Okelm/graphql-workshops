Let's wrap up knowledge from previous chapters and make an basic Query definition and resolvers for our app.

Apollo Server sets up GraphQL Playground so that you can run queries and explore your schema with ease. Go ahead and start your server by running `npm start` and open up the playground in a browser window at `http://localhost:4000/`.



1. Initialize apollo server project and run empty playground
2. Create a object type for Restaurant 
3. Create Query object type which returns:
   1. list of restaurants
   2. specific restaurant matched by ID
4. Implement resolver and data-source for restaurant type object
