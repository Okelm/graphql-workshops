# Tasks

### Add separate page for every restaurant

This page should show some data about given restaurant when user clicks on restaurant title. Somewhere on the page, logged-in users should be able to leave their review. 

1. **Add redirect link for restaurants on the list**
2. **Display info about restaurant on dedicated page**
3. **Add simple form where users can leave their review about restaurant**
4. **Add mutation on server for adding new reviews**
5. **Connect this mutation to newly created form**

In next section we will refactor this form to support optimistic UI update.
