# What is GraphQL?

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

"GraphQL is a **query language** for **APIs** and a **runtime** for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a **complete and understandable** description of the data in your API, gives clients the **power to ask** for **exactly what they need** and nothing more, **makes it easier** to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools."
